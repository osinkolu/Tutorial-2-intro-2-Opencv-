    "### About Opencv\n",
    "The OpenCV means Open Computer Vision, the library is indeed one of the first of its kind, it was originally developed by Intel, then supported by some others since about 1999.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation of the Opencv library.\n",
    "The opencv library can be easily installed through pip.\n",
    "command : pip install opencv-python\n",
    "\n",
    "### About imutils\n",
    "Thanks to Adrian rosebrock, owner and founder of pyimage search, he created a library tagged for image utility, included in this library are series of convenience functions to make basic image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, displaying Matplotlib images, sorting contours, detecting edges, and much more easier with OpenCV and both Python 2.7 and Python 3.\n",
